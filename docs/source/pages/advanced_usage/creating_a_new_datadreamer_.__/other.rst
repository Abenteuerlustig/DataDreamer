Creating a new ...
#######################################################

To create a new implementation of an embedder, retriever, or other DataDreamer class, you will want to subclass its base class.
You can see example implementations of various classes by clicking on the ``[source]`` links through the :doc:`API Reference <../../../datadreamer>` pages.
These may be helpful as reference implementations.

Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute the new class you created to DataDreamer for others to use, see the :doc:`Contributing <../../../pages/contributing>` page.
If applicable, please ensure your implementation includes appropriate metadata such as license and citation information.
