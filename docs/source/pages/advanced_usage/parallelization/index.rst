Parallelization
#######################################################

Parallelization is a core feature of DataDreamer that allows for performant workflows. Advanced users may want to implement
parallelization in different ways, depending on their use case. This section will cover the different ways parallelization
can be implemented in DataDreamer, including device parallelization (multi-GPU inference and training).
