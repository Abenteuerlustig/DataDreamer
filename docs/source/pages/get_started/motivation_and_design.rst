Motivation and Design
#######################################################

DataDreamer is an open-source Python library that is made to help streamline and accelerate increasingly common
LLM-related workflows for ML / NLP researchers and users and help increase the rate of research progress through
features encouraging open science and reproducibility.

Design Principles
=================

A few design principles of DataDreamer are:

- 🔬 **Research-Grade and Production-Grade:** Implementations of techniques that are consistent with the established work and best practices for correctness and efficiency.
- 💪 **Reproducibility and Robustness:**  A focus on `reproducibility and robustness <../../pages/get_started/overview_guide.html#reproducibility>`_.
- 🧩 **Simple with Sensible Defaults:** Simple and easy to get started with little configuration through sensible defaults.
- 🛠️ **Adaptable, Extensible, and Customizable:** Selectively overridable advanced configuration and the ability to support :doc:`new techniques <../../pages/advanced_usage/creating_a_new_datadreamer_.../step>` or :doc:`models <../../pages/advanced_usage/creating_a_new_datadreamer_.../llm>`.
- 👥 **Accessible:** :doc:`Aggressive caching and efficiency techniques <../../pages/get_started/overview_guide>` to make both computationally- and financially-expensive LLM-related workflows more accessible to resource-constrained researchers.
- 🤝 **Community-Driven:** Community members can :doc:`contribute <../../pages/contributing>` to extend DataDreamer's abilities.

For Anyone
==========

While DataDreamer was designed *for researchers, by researchers*, it is also meant to be accessible to
anyone who wants to use it.

Use in Teaching
===============

While DataDreamer was built to help researchers and practitioners implement complex LLM-related workflows, it is extremely simple to use making bleeding-edge models,
techniques, and training accessible to reasonably technical students.

If you are a university professor of a graduate-level NLP or machine learning course
and would like to trial using DataDreamer in your course for instruction, assignments, or projects please reach out to
